            <p>Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened?
                Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy,

            <p>I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I
                like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from
                here. That's your uncle talking.
                Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?I've never seen such devotion in a droid
                before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a
                relative of yours? Do you know who he's
                talking about?</p>
